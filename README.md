# carby

Introducing, Carby. Our #worldinnovationday hackathon solution to address UN #sustainabilitygoals.

Carby augments consumer purchase decision making with an easy to use tool that integrates seamlessly with life by considering current consumer purchasing behavior.

Consumers can use the Carby mobile application to take a photo of a product for in-the-moment image recognition. Advanced machine learning models, trained for product recognition, identify the item and return it's carbon footprint score. If the score is too high, better alternatives are presented.

With Carby, consumers have the ability to select from lower environmental impact options while still fulfilling the need for purchase.

The team worked tirelessly to build the solution. The concept was turned from ideation to working solution in just one weekend. 

We are proud of what we accomplished.
